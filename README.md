Oh The Places You'll See is a Skyrim SE Modlist with a focus on enhancing every location in the game and creating a Skyrim that always has something new to see or find.

While some locations are admittedly on the fancier side, the list tries to stay largely lore friendly and stay true to the feel of the original game.

While the focus of the list is on locations and exploration, some basic gameplay enhancements and overhauls are included. Most aspects of the world and the races therein is handled by the SkyRem series of mods by DrPharmDawg with Magic, Perks, and Supernatural Transformations being handled by the suite of Enai mods not covered by Skyrim.

The notable exception to this is combat, which is handled by a combination of Blade and Blunt by Simon Magus and Vigor - Enhanced Combat by Alex9ndre, making combat a much deeper experience than simply swinging the biggest stick in your inventory at enemies until they die.

But, of course, if you are here the part you are most likely interested in is the Places. Major Cities and Towns have been given complete overhauls by a combination of JK's Skyrim, Dawn of Skyrim, and The Great Cities of JK's North. All other minor settlements have been have been altered by a hand picked mix of mods, which I shall leave as a surprise. In addition, several of the major cities have received special additions. Many locations in the wilderness have been revamped as well, in large part because of the wonderful Reborn series by Mnikjom.

May Your Adventures be fulfilling and neverending.
